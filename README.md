Godot Slides a tool to create elegant slideshows with the Godot game engine, using drag and drop UI widget. As it's a Godot game, you can:

- Run **games inside your slides**
- **Translate your presentations** into many languages with only a spreadsheet editor
- **Animate anything** with the animation editor or tweens, add particles and sounds
- Or even be creative and display the slides inside of a game!

Godot Slides comes with the Power Pitch, a 10 minutes presentation of the engine available in multiple languages. It'll save you hours of work if you want to introduce Godot at meetups and other gamedev events. And you can customize it to better suit your needs!

You can find a video recording of the original 40 minutes intro to Godot 3 on [GDquest's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v3qge-3CqQ) (*Thanks to Gabriel Marais for the English translation*).

## Controls

You can change the slide with a swipe of your finger on a touchscreen, or by hovering and clicking on the arrows on the edges of the screen.

On a keyboard, press <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>p</kbd> to jump to the **next** and the **previous** slide respectively. You may also use <kbd>,</kbd> and <kbd>.</kbd>, the <kbd><</kbd> and <kbd>></kbd> keys on QWERTY keyboards. You can use the angle brackets to avoid colliding with the demos' input actions inside your slides.

## Help us translate the slides!

The Power Pitch ships with three languages in version 2.0:

- English
- French
- Japanese
- Spanish
- Portuguese (BR)
- German

Let's translate it in as many languages as possible! This way people can pitch Godot all around the world, in local game creator meetups.
